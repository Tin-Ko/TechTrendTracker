            About the job
            Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer

            Aevum is an American technology company that designs, develops, and provides autonomous air, space, and package transportation technologies. The company focuses on autonomous technologies, rapid logistics, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.



            We are an early-stage aerospace logistics company looking for a bright and motivated Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer to join our team. You will work closely with our Chief Software Architect (12+ years of Silicon Valley experience) to design and build the core frameworks and architecture that power our operations. This role is for someone with around 4-7 years of experience, though we value the quality of experience over the number of years. 



            What You’ll Do

            Work closely with the Chief Software Architect to build the core frameworks and architecture that will power the company's operations, with a particular focus on the prototyping and proof-of-concept phase of development 
            Develop and maintain web applications, internal tools, and backend systems that are scalable, maintainable, and future-proof 
            Contribute to defining and evolving our software architecture, with an emphasis on flexibility and long-term sustainability while meeting immediate needs 
            Collaborate on setting best practices for code quality, testing, and deployment, ensuring we build on a strong foundation as we scale 
            Tackle a wide range of core company problems, gaining a close-up view of key challenges and helping to shape the direction of the company's technical solutions through clean, efficient, and reliable code 
            Work across the full stack, iterating quickly to turn early-stage concepts into functional, production-ready solutions 


            What We’re Looking For

            Strong generalist software engineering skills, with a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles 
            Ability to work across the stack (front-end, back-end, with at least some experience with infrastructure and security)
            A preference for libraries and frameworks with powerful primitives over "magical" solutions (e.g., SolidStart or Remix over Next.js, FastAPI or Flask over Django or Rails) 
            Ability to write code quickly and efficiently—whether through proficiency with AI coding assistants or sufficient manual speed—since we have many projects in the prototyping and proof-of-concept stage
            Willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies as needed 
            Ability to take ownership of projects and work independently while collaborating closely with the team 
            Experience with Python and JavaScript
            This role will involve little to no low-level or embedded programming, though some experience there could be useful for integrations 


            Preferred

            Experience with SolidJS (preferred) or other modern frontend frameworks 
            Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, databases, or DevOps practices 
            Interest in aerospace, logistics, or operations research 
            Basic product and design sensibilities, with an ability to think about user experience and intuitive workflows


            EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
            {"skills": ["Python", "JavaScript", "SolidJS"]}


            Only return a JSON object in this EXACT format:
            {"skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3", "skill4", "etc"]}
